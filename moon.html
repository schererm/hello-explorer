    <p> Meet Earth's loyal companion, the Moon! This rocky satellite has been hanging around for about 4.5 billion years, probably formed when a Mars-sized object smashed into early Earth (scientists call this the Giant Impact Hypothesis, which sounds way more dramatic than it needs to be). The Moon is about 238,855 miles away from us on average, which sounds far but is actually pretty close in space terms. It's tidally locked to Earth, meaning the same side always faces us—so yeah, there really is a "dark side of the Moon" we never see from here. The Moon doesn't have an atmosphere, which is why it's covered in craters and why astronaut footprints from the Apollo missions are still there perfectly preserved. Its gravity is only about 1/6th of Earth's, so you'd weigh way less there (and could jump super high). Oh, and it's slowly drifting away from us at about 1.5 inches per year. Don't worry though, it's not going anywhere anytime soon.
