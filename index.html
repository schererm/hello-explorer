    <p> So here's the deal with Earth—it's basically the coolest planet in the neighborhood (at least as far as we know). This big blue marble is about 4.5 billion years old and sits at just the right distance from the Sun where water can be liquid, which is pretty clutch for all the life happening here. We've got oceans covering about 71% of the surface, a protective atmosphere that keeps us from getting fried by solar radiation, and this awesome magnetic field that makes compasses work. Earth is the third rock from the Sun, spinning once every 24 hours (that's your day-night cycle) and taking a full trip around the Sun every 365.25 days (hence why we need leap years). Fun fact: Earth is the only planet not named after a god or goddess—it comes from the Old English word "ertha" meaning ground. Pretty humble for such an important place, right?</p>
